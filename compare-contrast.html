                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Back when I still have no phone, I cannot afford to have Two-factor Authentication. I also use weak passwords during the past few years thinking that it won't get cracked easily. I think me and my classmates think the same thing. Perhaps, we are just too lazy to think about complex passwords because we might forget it later on. However, I do change my passwords every month though, and I wish my classmates do the same thing as well.</p>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>Personally, I am very lazy to install software updates manually and just let my computer install it whenever I shut it down. This is because I cannot afford to spend even a little time for my computer to update when I am about to do something, so usually, I let it update when it's time to turn it off. I think my classmates share the same sentiment because most of us want to spend our time with the things that make us happy and we just can't simply afford to free even just a little time for an update... And that's where I think we are wrong as software updates are very important as they continuously improve performance and better the security.</p>

                </div>
                 <div>
                     <p>Back in the days, I did not really care about the legitimacy of a website as long as I was having fun. Now, I still browse questionable websites because of desperation to find answers to questions. Even though my anti-virus says that the website I am about to open is unsecure, I still open it. But I only do this mostly because of school works. I do not usually browse unquestionable website if not needed. I think my classmates will agree on me with this one because we are students and I believe that this is a common mistake of, if not all, many students.</p>

                 <div>
                     <p>Well well well. I do this even now especially when I have no data. I usually connect to these Public Wi-Fi when I'm at the mall or any other public places that has free Wi-Fi access. Although I just connect to these free internet connections, I consider my privacy and safety. I am pretty sure almost all people do the same thing as well. I think this is because almost all people tend to be active online and hence whenever they go, they want to be online. I guess this is a mistake that we know but still do not avoid doing.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Thinking it won't happen to me</h3>
                <p>To be honest, this is the way I think before. Like I was always confident that my accounts won't be hacked because I always thought that I'm just a nobody on the internet. But I was wrong. I realized that it's something we should really be aware of because they might use your credentials and do bad stuffs and then that's when you're framed. I came across this quote saying "To those companies that think that they haven't been attacked yet, they aren't looking hard enough." I mean, it's really relevant to me because I was just carefree and just didn't care. I was really surprised when I did the "am I pwned?" thing. I did not expect that my email was pwned. Because of that, I realized that I wasn't really looking hard enough and I should change my way of thinking.</p>
                <p>I guess that's the only difference between me and my classmates. I think they're right. Like I think that they are seeing things differently and that they are kind of expecting that any time, their accounts may get hacked. I think that's a good thing because at least it won't catch you off-guard and by the time it happens, they're composed, if not 100%, then at least are more composed than I am.</p>
