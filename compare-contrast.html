                    <p>Despite hearing about breaches of big businesses and compromised personal data in the news regularly, I always think that “it won’t happen to me”.</p>

                    <p>I always thought that passwords cannot be identified if you type it fast. This was the thing that changed the way I think.</p>

                Commonalities of my mistakes and the mistakes of class GE TFL Group 2
             </h2>
            <div class="my-4">
                <p>In today’s connected world, everyone benefits from advanced cyberdefense programs. At an individual level, a cybersecurity attack can result in everything from identity theft, to extortion attempts, to the loss of important data like family photos. Everyone relies on critical infrastructure like power plants, hospitals, and financial service companies. Securing these and other organizations is essential to keeping our society functioning. I'd like to say that we also have to really pay attention to details and know the things that are worth knowing. So as a student, I'd like to let you read <a href="https://www.upguard.com/blog/cybersecurity-important#:~:text=Cybersecurity%20is%20important%20because%20it,from%20theft%20and%20damage%20attempted" style="font-style: oblique; color: blue;">The importance of Cybersecurity.</a></p>
                <p>
                    Here are the things that I did that changed my experience over the internet:

            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Know the Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
                <p>Knowing the things that you may get yourself into is one big advantage! Because you are aware that these threats are present, then that will make you less likely to get caught off-guard! The following are the cybersecurity threats that you need to know.</p>
                <div class="grid">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Phishing</h3>
                        <p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. It’s the most common type of cyber attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                        <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Malware</h3>
                        <p>Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>Social engineering</h3>
                        <p>Social engineering is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data. Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.</p>

            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Browse Anonymously for  a Hidden identity</h3>
                <p>The best way to hide online is to browse the web in a way that hides your identity. If your real information isn't being exposed to the web as you use it, then it's a lot less likely that someone will get your IP address, find out where you live, know that you are the one searching, target you with ads on your other devices, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Never put personal information on the web</h3>
                <p>It's hard to hide who you are online when your personal details are already out there! People search engines provide an easy way for anyone to research you to find your phone number, home address, email address, school history, relatives, age, full name, etc. Although you can't remove your information for good because it's all in the public domain on a variety of websites, and continually gets updated, you can do your best to delete what's out there right now by following this <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/remove-personal-information-from-internet-3482691" style="font-style:oblique; color: blue;">
                    Remove Personal information from the Internet

            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Log out of Websites and never save your password</h3>
                <p>This is of utmost importance when using a computer that other people can access when you're done, but it's equally as important at home or school if you want extra privacy. The task is simple: after you're finished with a website you're logged in to—like your bank account, social media page, email—just log out. If you stay logged in, you're not really hiding anything. Anyone else who uses the computer after you will be able to see not only who used the computer but also find all your emails, be able to post things to your social networks, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Use Strong Passwords</h3>
                <p>The most common way to protect your online identity is to focus on creating strong passwords. When creating a password, choose something that will not be easily cracked or decoded. Never use a word or number that someone can associate with you such as a first, middle, or last name, a spouse or child's name, address, phone numbers, employers, or other identifying letters or numbers. Mix up the letters and numbers used in your password and use symbols and a combination of upper and lowercase numbers when possible in order to <a href="https://programs.online.utica.edu/programs/masters-cybersecurity?cmgfrm=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" style="font-style: oblique; color: blue;">protect yourself from online security breaches.</a> Additionally, it is important to never share your password with anyone. It might be necessary to change your passwords a few times each year.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="my-4">
                <h3>Get Private Data Protection</h3>
                <p>Security suites are security programs that keep dishonest people and programs from infecting your computer and stealing information and data from you. This includes blocking harmful software such as spyware, viruses, and phishing scams that can be installed secretly when you are online. Some of the popular security suites include Norton Antivirus, McAfee Virus Protection, Ad-Aware Pro Security, and AVG Internet Security. Be sure to purchase and install one of these suites to protect your personal information online. Another way to protect your online identity and sensitive information when sharing it online is to get private data protection. This type of security suite will protect any private data that is included in emails, private messenger programs, social media sites, or in various blogs. If you do not have any resources to buy or subscribe for an anti-virus, here is the<a href="https://www.antivirussoftwareguide.com/best-free-antivirus" style="font-style: oblique; color: blue;">Top 10 Best Free Antivirus Software (2020)</a>. By employing a private data protection suite, you can further prevent hackers from gathering your personal information. Basically, it's the thing that I basically did that made my presence online different.</p>
