               My Personal Experience in Cyberspace

                    <h3>What are the usual fixes to each of your cybersecurity risk?</h3>
                    <p>When I started my journey on the internet, I barely know stuff. I usually just didn't care because I thought I was safe not until I got a notice that someone tried to open my Facebook! Although the contents of my account that time was just pure garbage, I startled. So what I did was just to basically change all my passwords. I could not afford to use a two-way authentication because I do not have any phone at that time since that was like, a decade ago. Ever since that happened, I usually change my password every 2 to 3 months to reduce the risk of being hacked.</p>
                    <p>
                        So when I got my first ever phone, the first thing that I did was to set up 2-way authentication of all my accounts. This was the most effective thing to do because ever since I set up a 2-way authentication, I never got a notice that someone was trying to open one of my accounts.

                <div class="card">
                    <i class="fas fa-user-shield fa-5x"></i>
                    <h3>What fix is hardest to implement?</h3>
                    <p>To be honest, there was nothing really hard. I mean, I always believed that if you really want to do it, you will find a way to actually do it and so I find ways like BDO to protect my data and myself on the internet. Perhaps, the thing that was difficult is to actually find a solution; not how to implement the solution.</p>

                    <i class="fas fa-user-lock fa-5x"></i>
                    <h3>What are your alternative fixes?</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, we are too careless to just click and open URLs and links that are given to us by our Facebook friends not knowing that these might be viruses! One alternative fix to this is to actually read what the link or the URL says. This really saved me a couple of times! I mean, a friend of mine told me that something was wrong about his account - that it's sending people inappropriate messages. Later, I found out that he was click-baited by a post and so, I was very thankful that I did not click the link he sent me. Because of that experience, I decided not to simply open URLs and links given to me by my Facebook friends. I mean, I'd first ask them like what the link is for and what it is going to do with me. Basically, I am just saying that one of the fixes for this is to actually learn to question things so as to avoid getting tricked.</p>

                    <h3>What's the best fix for you?</h3>
                    <p>To be honest, the very best fix that I did was to actually subscribe to an anti-virus! Just two years ago, I finally decided to subscribe to an anti-virus called Trend Micro. This anti-virus really helped me with my security over the internet. Basically, it helped me distinguish unsecure links as it highlights links that are not secure and might be a spam. It also blocks advertisements that can pontentially give malwares as I open websites most espcially Kissanime lol. Also, it blocks suspicious files that I download over the internet! Like files I downloaded from U Torrent. It also gives me the power to put passwords on each folders on my local machine, this protects my files from being hijacked by some ransomware. And many more! I can really say that one of the best fix that I have done was to actually subscribe to an anti-virus! This is because I know that we cannot afford to wait when it comes to our own security over the internet.</p>
